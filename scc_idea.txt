A more simplier design would be to present the roll at once, use the computer to evaluate if they have ship, captain or crew.
Allow the player to view the roll before they roll again.
If they have a ship, captain and crew they can loot.
Must have ship before captain. Captain before crew. Crew before loot.
They can claim loot on the same roll if they dice if the ship, captain and crew are rolled.
They can select the dice or dice to roll again.
They only have up to three rolls.
